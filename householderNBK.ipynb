    "QR decomposition is a widely discussed topic in the realms of Linear Algebra. If you've ever taught someone how to factorize a 4x4 matrix and came across some algebraic obstacles when teaching the Gram-Schmidt or Householder method, finding yourself lost in a a series of square-root calculations (which had to be done wothout the aid of a calculator), we have an algorithm that could make your life a little easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program was written in Python with the aid of the symbolic computing library sympy, and what we do is search a finite list for values that would make \"good\" columns for our input matrix. Then, we test one of the possible so called rational matrices against the Householder factorizing algorithm and check if it in fact renders rational calculations. See below a full demonstration of the method:"
